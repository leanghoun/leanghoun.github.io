# A Repository
{: .fs-9 .text-purple-300 }

Sometimes, I need help remembering things.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

With projects, things can get messy. It would be nice to consolidate notes and thoughts in a searchable way. Late in 2021, I started sourcing items to build a [Voron Trident]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/collections/3d-printing/voron-trident.md %}), and while researching the build, I noticed that their [documentation website](https://docs.vorondesign.com/) was built using something called [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs). This is my take on a living journal of stuff using the same platform.
