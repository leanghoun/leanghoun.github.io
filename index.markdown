# A Repository
{: .fs-9 .text-purple-300 }

Sometimes, I need help remembering things.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Late in 2021, I started sourcing items to build a [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/). While researching the build, I noticed that the [Voron documentation website](https://docs.vorondesign.com/) had this badge in the footer:

> _This site uses [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs), a documentation theme for Jekyll._
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }

One long rabbit hole (and a few nuked test repositories) later, this site was born.
