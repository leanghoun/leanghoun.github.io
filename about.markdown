# About This Site

This is just an online repository for me to jot things down in a semi-permanent state. Going through the GitHub commit/push process also forces me to organize my thoughts.

## About The Theme: Just the Docs

This GitHub Page uses [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs), a documentation theme for Jekyll.
