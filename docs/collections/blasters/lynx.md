## Introduction

The Lynx is an open-source spring-powered blaster designed by Orion Blasters. CAD file and STL files are available [here](https://orionblasters.com/lynx/), and hardware kits are available [here](https://orionblasters.com/product/lynx-hardware-kit/).

### Features

*(Pulled from the Orion Blasters' Lynx page)*

The Lynx is a Bullpup Mag-Fed Pump-Action Homemade Blaster for half length darts designed for the sport of Competitive Dart Tag. It features closed bolt mag swaps, slam-fire, is compatible with all longshot and talon claw springs, and can be completely disassembled without tools.

## Build Guide

### Plunger

![Test Fitment with Turnaround](../../../../assets/images/lynx-03-plunger-3.jpg)
*Test Fitment with Turnaround*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The o-ring nut controls how squished the o-ring is. You want it squished enough to get a good seal with the turnaround, but not so much that it's hard to insert.

### Magwell

![Magwell Parts](../../../../assets/images/lynx-07-magwell-1.jpg)

It's a bit of a balancing act to get the spring seated while wrapping the release arms around the magwell, but it's doable.

### Ram Bar

![Ram Bar Parts](../../../../assets/images/lynx-09-ram-bar-1.jpg)

Take note of the orientation of the bar. The left cutout MUST be on the bottom.

Similar to the plunger assembly, the ram has an o-ring that is adjusted by tightening the screw.

### Receiver

![Plastic Screws Installed](../../../../assets/images/lynx-16-receiver-3.jpg)
*Plastic Screws Installed*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The plastic screws and matching nuts go on top of the receiver and are responsible for holding the barrel in place. There are hex-shaped recesses inside the receiver to hold the nuts while the screws insert from the outside.

The trigger and sear are pinned in place with shafts. It helps to drill out the holes in plastic with a 3/32 drill bit for clearance.

![Trigger and Sear Installed](../../../../assets/images/lynx-17-receiver-4.jpg)
*Trigger and Sear Installed*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Don't forget the spring!

![Test Trigger and Sear Action](../../../../assets/images/lynx-18-receiver-5.jpg)
*Test Trigger and Sear Action*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Check the trigger and sear action. When the trigger is not pulled, the sear should be flush.

![Test Trigger and Sear Action](../../../../assets/images/lynx-19-receiver-6.jpg)
*Test Trigger and Sear Action*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

When the trigger is pulled, the sear should rotate up.

The trigger guard flex-fits into place.

### Pump Catch

Oops. Not shown are the 4 screws that secure the catch parts.

![Pump Installed](../../../../assets/images/lynx-22-pump-catch-2.jpg)
*Pump Installed*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The 4 screws with toothed washers secure the pump to the front of the bars.

![Smaller Catch Housing](../../../../assets/images/lynx-23-pump-catch-3.jpg)
*Smaller Catch Housing*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Secure the smaller catch housing first..

![Catch and Spring](../../../../assets/images/lynx-24-pump-catch-4.jpg)
*Catch and Spring*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

...then place the spring and reinforced catch like this. The flatter side of the catch should be facing towards the rear of the blaster.

![Larger Catch Housing](../../../../assets/images/lynx-25-pump-catch-5.jpg)
*Larger Catch Housing*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Add the larger catch housing to trap the catch, insert the aluminum tube, and secure the tube with screws.

![Test With Plunger](../../../../assets/images/lynx-26-pump-catch-6.jpg)
*Test With Plunger*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Test the catch with the plunger assembly.

![Test With Plunger](../../../../assets/images/lynx-27-pump-catch-7.jpg)
*Test With Plunger*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Inserting the plunger should lock against the catch, and pressing on the catch should release the plunger.

### Turnaround

Slide the spacer on. There are dedicated channels for all 3 bars.

![Add Plunger Tube](../../../../assets/images/lynx-41-final-assembly-12.jpg)
*Add Plunger Tube*

![Add Thumb Release](../../../../assets/images/lynx-45-final-assembly-16.jpg)
*Add Thumb Release*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

If you are using the optional thumb release, add it before sliding the receiver all the way.

![Add Thumb Release](../../../../assets/images/lynx-46-final-assembly-17.jpg)
*Add Thumb Release*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Add Plunger and Spring](../../../../assets/images/lynx-47-final-assembly-18.jpg)
*Add Plunger and Spring*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Add some silicone grease around the oring to facilitate plunger action against the clear tube.

![Add Plunger and Spring](../../../../assets/images/lynx-48-final-assembly-19.jpg)
*Add Plunger and Spring*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Add Ram Bar](../../../../assets/images/lynx-49-final-assembly-20.jpg)

![Add Ram Bar](../../../../assets/images/lynx-50-final-assembly-21.jpg)
*Add Ram Bar*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

You will need lift up the ram bar to slide the pump assembly through. The pump fits in the notch in the ram bar.

![Add Picatinny Rails](../../../../assets/images/lynx-51-final-assembly-22.jpg)

![Add Barrel](../../../../assets/images/lynx-55-final-assembly-26.jpg)
*Add Barrel*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

You might need to loosen the top plastic screws to feed the barrel through. As the barrel bottoms out, it will push through the two o-rings inside the turnaround. Be careful that you don't push them out of place. Retighten the top plastic screws to secure the barrel.
