Bought on a whim, but I've been a longtime fan of Panic ever since the early Coda days. Nova is modern Coda, but re-written from the ground up. Maybe it'll be a good long-term IDE for me to play with.

## Basic Features
* Developed especially for Mac
* Project organization
* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Github integration
* Terminal integration
* Build/Run with terminal commands

## Features of Particular Interest

### Ephemeral Tabs
Single click a document in the file browser and the document opens in an 'ephemeral' tab, denoted by the filename being displayed in italics. Clicking on any other document(s) will use the same tab, preventing tab overload just to find that *one* bit of code you are looking for.

### Build/Run Tasks
Testing this GitHub Page locally requires a terminal to run Jekyll and serve up the pages on runtime. Normally, I'd have a separate terminal open, but it's kind of nice that Nova can handle custom Build/Run tasks with terminal commands. I can see custom Build tasks really handy for building mechanical keyboard hex files.

## Extensions of Particular Interest

### Prettier
~~But I'm getting a "NPM not installed" warning.~~ Node.js installed and Prettier works now, but it messes with Just the Docs theme that I'm using for this GitHub Page. Disabled for this project.
