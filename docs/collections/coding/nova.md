Bought on a whim, but I've been a longtime fan of Panic ever since the early Coda days. As an IDE with tons of built-in features, maybe it'll be a good long-term coding environment for me to play with.

* Project organization
* Syntax highlighting
* Github integration
* Terminal integration
* Build/Run with terminal commands
