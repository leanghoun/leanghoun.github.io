*These Front Z-Covers Are Hard - 1: Had to reprint these due to the seam landing on the curved overhang. Aligned the infill angles to follow the Voron logo on the first layer as well.*

*Main Colors Initial Test - 1: KVP Industrial Gray. Came with a bit more shine than I had hoped.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-2.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 2: Kinda disappointed at the roughness of this filament. The slight gloss makes it an unforgiving. Almost as rough as titanium whites.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 4](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-4.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 4: Yeah, the gloss reflects light too much. Shows at certain angles very poorly.*
