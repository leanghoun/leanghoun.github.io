![Even More Accent Parts](../../../../assets/images/micron-4-these-front-z-covers-are-hard-1.jpg)
*These Front Z-Covers Are Hard - 1: Had to reprint these due to the seam landing on the curved overhang. Aligned the infill angles to follow the Voron logo on the first layer as well.*

![Main Colors FF Mushroom Cloud Gray - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-8-ff-mushroom-cloud-gray-1.jpg)
*Main Colors FF Mushroom Cloud Gray - 1: Soo much better than glossy gray. This one is great! I also ordered their sparkly matte Thorium Thilver, but I think this non-sparkly matte Mushroom Cloud Gray will let Electrolytic Deuterium really stand out.*

{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Prepping Rails - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-2.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 2: Flushed the rail and carriage with some isopropyl alcohol and used the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rail's grooves. Sprayed a bit of white lithium grease into the ball bearings until they were all coated, but not sopping wet. Added a bit of white lithium grease to the rail's grooves and used my finger to spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.*

![Prepping Rails - 3](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-3.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 3: Re-assembled the carriages and rails, moved the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.*

![Fasteners Organized](../../../../assets/images/micron-11-fasteners-organized.jpg)
*Fasteners Organized: Organize the screws. Left column contains West3D's Stainless Steel "Best Damn Fasteners" for Micron, sorted from smallest to largest. Middle column contains the stock fasteners from DFH's kit, a mixture of black oxide and stainless steel. Right columns hold nuts, shims/washers, heatset inserts, etc.*
