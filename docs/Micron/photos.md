![Printing Begins!](../../../../assets/images/micron-0-printing-begins-1.jpg)
*Printing Begins! - 1: Should have disabled tramming and mesh between color swaps. The difference in bed position caused the logo to offset just slightly.*

*Printing Begins! - 2: This Fusion Filaments Electrolytic Deuterium is printing incredibly well though!*

![Printing Begins Again!](../../../../assets/images/micron-1-oops-printing-begins-again-1.jpg)
*Printing Begins Again! - 1: Oops. STLs in the Micron Github are for Dragon hotend, while the DFH kit comes with a Dragonfly BMO. Need to reprint using the toolhead STLs from v0.1 Github. Also a chance to get that logo centered.*

*These Front Z-Covers Are Hard - 1: Had to reprint these due to the seam landing on the curved overhang. Aligned the infill angles to follow the Voron logo on the first layer as well.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-1.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 1: KVP Industrial Gray. Came with a bit more shine than I had hoped.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Main Colors Initial Test - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-2.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 2: Kinda disappointed at the roughness of this filament. The slight gloss makes it an unforgiving. Almost as rough as titanium whites.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 4](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-4.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 4: Yeah, the gloss reflects light too much. Shows at certain angles very poorly.*
