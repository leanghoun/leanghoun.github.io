*These Front Z-Covers Are Hard - 1: Had to reprint these due to the seam landing on the curved overhang. Aligned the infill angles to follow the Voron logo on the first layer as well.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-1.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 1: KVP Industrial Gray. Came with a bit more shine than I had hoped.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Main Colors Initial Test - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-2.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 2: Kinda disappointed at the roughness of this filament. The slight gloss makes it unforgiving. Almost as rough as titanium whites.*

![Main Colors Initial Test - 4](../../../../assets/images/micron-5-main-colors-initial-test-4.jpg)
*Main Colors Initial Test - 4: Yeah, the gloss reflects light too much. Shows at certain angles very poorly.*

*Prepping Rails - 1*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Prepping Rails - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-2.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 2: Flushed the rail and carriage with some isopropyl alcohol and used the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rail's grooves. Sprayed a bit of white lithium grease into the ball bearings until they were all coated, but not sopping wet. Added a bit of white lithium grease to the rail's grooves and used my finger to spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

![Prepping Rails - 3](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-3.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 3: Re-assembled the carriages and rails, moved the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.*

![Main Colors FF Mushroom Cloud Gray - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-8-ff-mushroom-cloud-gray-1.jpg)
*Main Colors FF Mushroom Cloud Gray - 1: Soo much better than glossy gray. This one is great! I also ordered their sparkly matte Thorium Thilver, but I think this non-sparkly matte Mushroom Cloud Gray will let Electrolytic Deuterium really stand out.*

![FF Mushroom Cloud Gray vs KVP Industrial Gray](../../../../assets/images/micron-9-kvp-industrial-gray-v-ff-mushroom-cloud-gray.jpg)
*FF Mushroom Cloud Gray vs KVP Industrial Gray: You can see how much the gloss in KVP Industrial Gray emphasizes print imperfections.*
