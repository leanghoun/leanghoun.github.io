## Sorting the Fasteners

![Fasteners Organized](../../../../assets/images/micron-11-fasteners-organized.jpg)
*Fasteners Organized*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The DFH Micron kit comes with all the required fasteners, but in a mix of black oxide and stainless steel, and a mix of resealable zip pouches and tear pouches. With the colors I chose (Fusion Filaments' Electrolytic Deuterium and Mushroom Cloud Gray), I wanted the lighter color of stainless steel so I bought a set of West3D's "Best Damn Fasteners" for the Micron. They really are great!

Organize the screws. Left column contains West3D's "Best Damn Fasteners", sorted from smallest to largest. Middle column contains the stock fasteners from DFH's kit. Right columns hold nuts, shims/washers, heatset inserts, etc.

## Prepping the Rails

![Prepping Rails - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-1.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 1*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Flush the rails and carriages with some isopropyl alcohol and use the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rails' grooves. Spray a bit of white lithium grease into the carriages' ball bearings until they are all coated, but not sopping wet. Add a bit of white lithium grease to the rails' grooves, and spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.

![Prepping Rails - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-7-prepping-rails-2.jpg)
*Prepping Rails - 2*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Re-assemble the carriages and rails, move the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.

## Z Rail Assemblies

Slide a nut bar into the aluminum slot. Use a small allen key to push as necessary.

![Insert Nut Bar into Extrusion](../../../../assets/images/micron-12-z-rail-1-insert-nut-bars.jpg)
*Insert Nut Bar into Extrusion*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Align the MGN7 linear rails so that the holes line up to the nut bar. Add two M2x6 SHCS to the ends and lightly screw them in.

*Place the MGN7 Linear Rail*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Attach the printed jigs to both ends of the linear rail and ensure they are flat against a surface. This will center the rail and set it ~36mm from the end of the aluminum extrusion.

Add the remaining screws. I like to start on the ends and work my way to the center, skipping every other one. In this case, the two in the very center both end up filled.

Slide in M3 nuts from both ends of the aluminum extrusion and secure the printed end stops with M3x8 BHCS.

## Assembling the Frame

Standard blind-joint assembly. Remember that the vertical members with the linear rails touch the table, and the rails are on the lower half.

*Frame Assembly - 3*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Make sure to pre-insert any necessary M3 nuts as you go. It's not possible to add them later without some disassembly. In my case, because (1) I'm using a v0.1 aluminum bed with 3-hole mounting and (2) using the leftover 10x11 cable chain from my Trident build, the amount of nuts will not match the manual. This is a good time to add nuts for future mods as well.

Now that the basic frame is assembled, this is a good time to check for squareness. For each face, measure the two diagonals to see if they are within 1mm of each other. For the bottom, check to make sure it's not rocking.

I'm prepping these bed extrusions the older horizontal way with the front cap to line up with the mounting holes on the v0.1 bed.

![Frame Assembly - 12](../../../../assets/images/micron-13-frame-12.jpg)

## Z Joints

Insert the Igus KGLM-3 spherical bearings into the printed parts and secure each one with 4 M2x6 SHCS. These bearings can rotate in 3 dimensions and allow the gantry to adjust.

## Z Drive

I created a little 3.5mm spacer to set the proper distance between the two pulleys on the shaft. Holding the bottom bearing with the M5 shims is fiddly. You *will* keep dropping them and picking them off the floor until these assemblies go into the printed housings. The printed wheels are very easy to mount at an angle, which will introduce drift to the belt loop. Try to keep things square, and secure the grub screws in an X pattern to keep things even.

![Z Drive - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-16-z-drive-1.jpg)

{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Testing the pulley assembly in the housing *without* the belt is a good way to see how planar the wheel's rotation is.

When mounting the motors to the frame, it's important that the motor pulleys are parallel to the corner Z drive shafts. This will keep the belts centers on the pulleys. If they are canted, the belt will drift and rub against the pulley sides.

## Z Idlers

According to the manual, M3x16 BHCS are used to secure the two printed parts together, but neither the DFH kit nor the West3D fasteners kit came with any. Additionally, even M3x12 BHCS poked out a bit far through the nuts. I opted to use M3x10 BHCS and they look perfect.

*Update: hartk confirmed that they are intended to be M3x12 BHCS.*

## Z Endstop

There are supposed to be four M3 shims to extend the barrel. In my case, the screw is already short, so they are not necessary. I will use a bit of low strength thread locker later to set the proper height.

## Bed

This is a bed from PrecisePrinterParts. A few of the nicer features are the thermistor slot, indexing hole for flex plate alignment, and flatness within 0.02mm.

![Bed - 1](../../../../assets/images/micron-21-bed-1.jpg)
*Bed - 1*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

To keep the thermistor from sliding back out, I added a dab of super glue. The datasheet says it should be able to withstand up to 275°F, so it should hold for awhile.

![Bed - 2](../../../../assets/images/micron-21-bed-2.jpg)
*Bed - 2*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Installing the Graviflex magnetic sheet just like how Nero does it. Peel back a small section to align to one edge. Tack the adhesive down with even pressure from the center towards the sides. Peel back a bit more and tack it down. Repeat until covered and trim the excess.

![Bed - 3](../../../../assets/images/micron-21-bed-3.jpg)
*Bed - 3*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The safety pin is to poke a hole through the Graviflex for locating on the top side. Cutting the screw holes in the Graviflex sheet was actually pretty hard. The adhesive has a lot more stretch than the standard stuff and the leather punches I use for clean holes didn't cut it (literally). I used an exactly knife to remove some, and used a suitable sized leather punch to force the remaining edge material down into the countersunk holes.

Fabreek's edge-to-edge heater. I had to trim just the tiniest bit around the 3 mounting holes to make space for the knurled nut standoffs (not shown in the photo). I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS.

*ZeroFilter - 3*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Here is where I ran into a couple of issues. The deck's center hole is not centered to the ZeroFilter, and moving the horizontal extrusions to make room for the parts pushes out the front mount for the bed a bit too far. I adjusted and reprinted both the deck panel and the front mount, and I added another brace to the front of the ZeroFilters to keep it all square and tight.

## Y Axis

There is a printed jig for setting the distance of the linear rails from the ends, but I found that with it's curved inner corners, it was not accurate enough for me. I had to go back with calipers to nail the centering. The other jig from the Z rails is also useful here.

## A/B Idlers

If you look at the shims closely, you can see that they are punched out of a sheet and one side is smoother and the edges don't catch. This is the side I prefer to place against the bearings. The rougher side will face plastic.

Its easy to get the parts confused. You'll know you did it right if the SHCS heads on the tensioners (the accent parts) are on top.

After soldering the wires and directing them into the wire channel, they naturally form 90° bends. Should be fine I think. I'll try to remember to zip tie this up somewhere for some relief.
