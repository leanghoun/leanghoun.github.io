## Sorting the Fasteners

![Fasteners Organized](../../../../assets/images/micron-11-fasteners-organized.jpg)
*Fasteners Organized*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

The DFH Micron kit comes with all the required fasteners, but in a mix of black oxide and stainless steel, and a mix of resealable zip pouches and tear pouches. With the colors I chose (Fusion Filaments' Electrolytic Deuterium and Mushroom Cloud Gray), I wanted the lighter color of stainless steel so I bought a set of West3D's "Best Damn Fasteners" for the Micron. They really are great!

Organize the screws. Left column contains West3D's "Best Damn Fasteners", sorted from smallest to largest. Middle column contains the stock fasteners from DFH's kit. Right columns hold nuts, shims/washers, heatset inserts, etc.

## Prepping the Rails

Flush the rails and carriages with some isopropyl alcohol and use the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rails' grooves. Spray a bit of white lithium grease into the carriages' ball bearings until they are all coated, but not sopping wet. Add a bit of white lithium grease to the rails' grooves, and spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.

{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Re-assemble the carriages and rails, move the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.

## Z Rail Assemblies

Slide a nut bar into the aluminum slot. Use a small allen key to push as necessary.

*Insert Nut Bar into Extrusion*
{: .fs-2 .text-grey-dk-000 }

Align the MGN7 linear rails so that the holes line up to the nut bar. Add two M2x6 SHCS to the ends and lightly screw them in.

Attach the printed jigs to both ends of the linear rail and ensure they are flat against a surface. This will center the rail and set it ~36mm from the end of the aluminum extrusion.

Add the remaining screws. I like to start on the ends and work my way to the center, skipping every other one. In this case, the two in the very center both end up filled.

Slide in M3 nuts from both ends of the aluminum extrusion and secure the printed end stops with M3x8 BHCS.
