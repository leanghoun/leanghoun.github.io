## Prepping the Rails

Flushed the rails and carriages with some isopropyl alcohol and used the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rails' grooves. Sprayed a bit of white lithium grease into the carriages' ball bearings until they were all coated, but not sopping wet. Added a bit of white lithium grease to the rails' grooves and used my finger to spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.

Re-assembled the carriages and rails, moved the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.
