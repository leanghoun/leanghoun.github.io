*Prepping Rails - 2: Flushed the rail and carriage with some isopropyl alcohol and used the itty bitty allen key to push a bit of paper towel through the rail's grooves. Sprayed a bit of white lithium grease into the ball bearings until they were all coated, but not sopping wet. Added a bit of white lithium grease to the rail's grooves and used my finger to spread and coat the rail to prevent rust.*

*Prepping Rails - 3: Re-assembled the carriages and rails, moved the carriages back and forth along the entire lengths to ensure good spread of the white lithium.*
